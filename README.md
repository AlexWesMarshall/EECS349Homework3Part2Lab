EECS 349 Computer Security Homework 3 Part 2 Lab
For question 1 and 2 I developed the MyCall app in Android studio.
It utilizes the phones built in features to send texts and make calls.
For question 3 I developed the MalDroid app in Android studio.
It uses intents to invoke the MyCall app. 
To give an example of how intents can be exploited I included an article.
tl:dr you can decompile apks and look at intents which could give hackers insider knowledge of your app.
